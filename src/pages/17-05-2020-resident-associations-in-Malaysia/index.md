_What is written here is of my own personal experience and opinion, please do your own research where necessary._

This will be the first of many series in talking about Resident Associations & Rukun Tetangga in Malaysia. My aim is to bring more awareness and understanding to the roles of such associations in Malaysia.

Resident Associations (RA) and Rukun Tetanggas (RT) are usually non-profit organizations and its members provide its services  without remuneration. In this day and age, I believe most RA and RT's currently share the same aim which is namely to manage the security of the neighborhood the society operates in.

To manage security of the neighorhood, associations are usually involved in the hiring of security companies who employ local or foreign guards while ensuring adequate security services are being provided in the neighborhood.

While RA's are able to employ security companies, I have not heard of any RT's that have the luxury to hire such security companies.
One of the ways RT's mitigate their security issue is by employing part-time 'guards' (e.g. local residents) that are stationed at entrance or exits of a neighborhood. A neigborhood watch is also commonly found in an RT as the residents regularly conduct patrols around their neigborhood. At a police meet and greet event, I witnessed how an RT member explained that he had a full set of security necessity (e.g. torchlight, baton and etc.) at their bedside table ready to respond to any security emergencies in their neigborhood.

Other crucial aims of RT/RA could include:
- Fostering a sense of community among fellow residents
  - This can be achieved by organizing regular events or festivals such as gotong-royongs, family days, kenduris and etc. The ability of an RA/RT to hold these events depends on the capabilities and assistance the RA/RT has.
- Empowering the community with a greater voice as compared to a lone individual
  - For example, with the recent MRT/LRT developments around Malaysia, RA/RT's have been working with the local authorities to mitigate the problems of such rapid development near their neigborhoods.
  - Another advantage of a united voice gives the community a bigger bargaining power when it comes to solving disputes with external parties (e.g. property developers)

From my personal experience, the neighborhood that I have lived in, our RA was first set up around 20 years ago to unify all residents' voice in forcing the housing developer to rectify many major defects in many of the newly built homes that residents have just moved in to. After this initial fiasco, the neigborhood was plagued with break-ins and robberies. The RA then pivoted its aim to reduce crime rates around the neigborhood by mainting a dedicated security service for the neigborhood.

A major difference between an Resident Association (RA) & Rukun Tetangga (RT) is an RT may or may not receive regular contributions from its residents. Where regular contributions are present, an RT is believed to have much less funds as compared to RAs'. As such RTs' do not usually employ security companies.

RA's and RT's are not as blessed as associations working in multistorey buildings (e.g. apartment, condos, etc.) also known as Joint Management Bodies (JMB) or Management Corporations (MC). This is due to the fact JMB and MC's are bound by the Strata Management Act (SMA) whereas RA and RT's do not have similar established legalities behind them.

Although RA and RT has its differences, security remains a crucial matter for these associations and still remains so until this day. This was why I developed [BUCA](https://www.google.com), a simple application that RA and RTs to monitor security in addition to various other responsibilities of such associations.

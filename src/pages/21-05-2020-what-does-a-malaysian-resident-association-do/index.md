_What is written here is of my own personal experience and opinion, please do your own research where necessary._

This is my second series in talking about Resident Associations (RA) in Malaysia. The aim of this blog post is to give readers a better understanding of what day-to-day operations in the RA looks like.

Internal
Security
Administrative

External
Legalities
Responsiblities
Grants

As mentioned in my [RA Series #1](https://www.samsheng.my/resident-association-and-rukun-tetangga), societies in Malaysia such as RA and Rukun Tetangga primary focus is on security. The basic securities concerns are:
- Ensuring details of vehicles and visitors entering the neigborhood are recorded
- Regular patrolling of the neigborhood area
